# Image-Caption-Generator
DS 440 project

Our project is an image caption generation web application that could accurately describe the content of an image in natural language. We used the Flickr8K dataset to train our model, VGG 16 model to extract features from the dataset, and LSTM to predict the caption with a translation function. To make our model accessible to end-users, we created a web application using Ngrok and Streamlit. Captions generated by our application were accurate to the image of common objects in our daily life.
